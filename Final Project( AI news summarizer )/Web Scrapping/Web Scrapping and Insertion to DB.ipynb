      "Bangladesh Bank and the interim government are undertaking significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, focusing on recovering both local and foreign assets embezzled by corrupt individuals.\n",
      "Officials have confirmed that these assets, laundered abroad, are being targeted for repatriation as part of a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards, reports UNB.\n",
      "The government emphasized its commitment to reforming the financial sector, acknowledging that the process is complex and time-consuming.\n",
      "A key element of this strategy will be the establishment of a banking commission tasked with investigating each implicated bank, uncovering the full extent of the corruption, and developing an action plan, according to the Chief Adviser’s press wing.\n",
      "This plan, which can be implemented within six months, aims to overhaul the sector to ensure compliance with global banking norms.\n",
      "The aim of Bangladesh Bank and the government is to be capable of complying with all international standards and building a strong banking sector.\n",
      "However, international technical assistance and funding will be required from the beginning to the end of the activities to achieve this objective.\n",
      "The reforms come in response to revelations that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have embezzled vast sums from the banking sector, laundering the funds abroad through fraudulent activities.\n",
      "Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1.0 trillion, though the exact figure is still being determined.\n",
      "Significant steps have already been taken, with reforms initiated in several banks linked to the scandal.\n",
      "The boards of Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, National Bank, United Commercial Bank, Global Islami Bank, and Union Bank have been reconstituted as part of the restructuring efforts. Similar measures will be implemented across other affected banks and financial institutions.\n",
      "The government has also sought assistance from foreign agencies to track and repatriate the laundered funds. As the new management teams take control, they will be responsible for gathering accurate data on the embezzled amounts and leading the recovery efforts.\n",

      "Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Dr Fahmida Khatun said the list for the interim government for immediate and midterm measures is long but some of the measures have to start during its term.\n",
      "She said the measures taken by the interim government should be carried out by the next government also when the new elected government comes.\n",
      "“But the initiatives have to be taken now, and this is the time,” she said while speaking at a webinar, noting that the challenges for the interim government are humongous.\n",
      "The economist said first of all, the interim government has to ensure political stability and also restore law and order situation because these are preconditions for economic prosperity and economic growth.\n",
      "She said the political turmoil which they have observed, during the student-led movement and also some of the actions by the previous government like Internet blackout, have an impact on the economy in the immediate term, and it will also have an impact in the medium term.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said these challenges are very difficult to deal with within limited time.\n",
      "She said the economy observed a reasonable rate of growth but there was a lack of authenticity of data during the past regime and the numbers were inflated as those were far from reality.\n",
      "“I have written earlier, that Bangladesh's growth story lacks justice and humanity, and this, I described from the point of the distributional aspect of the growth and the qualitative part of the growth,” she said, adding that that is why the student movement for quota reform was the manifestation of bigger problems that policymakers had overlooked for decades.\n",
      "In fact, Dr Fahmida said, the economy now requires reforms and there is a need for institutional reforms to bring discipline to the economic system.\n",
      "She said the corruption model which has been created over the decades, has benefited certain groups which she has mentioned by depriving the larger sections of the people.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida observed how the political turmoil in Bangladesh during the student-led mass uprising in July and August led to the collapse of the government on 5th August 2024.\n",
      "“So with this change, the interim government has to work on almost every front to fulfil the ambition of the students and people of the country. This is extremely challenging as the system has almost collapsed during the last 15 years,” she said.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said the challenges on the economic front are formidable. Some of these challenges include high inflation, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, inefficiency and corruption in public projects implementation, low tax GDP ratio, low private and foreign investment, a weak financial sector, high nonperforming loans in the banking sector, illicit financial outflow, unemployment, and also poverty and inequality.\n",
      "Right to Freedom Board Member Jon Danilowicz moderated the webinar while Right to Freedom Executive Director Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey gave a brief introduction of the panel of speakers and Ambassador (retd) William B Milam, Board President of the R2F offered opening remarks.\n",
      "Director of the South Asia Institute at Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Michael Kugelman and Secretary, Citizens for Good Governance Dr. Badiul Alam Mazumdar spoke at the webinar which aimed to foster conversations on critical aspects of Bangladesh’s new journey under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus.\n",

      "Despite the interim government’s strong commitment to recover money laundered out of Bangladesh, experts say that the process will be challenging and complicated, reports UNB.\n",
      "A recent press statement from the Chief Adviser’s Office highlighted the government and Bangladesh Bank’s significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, with a particular focus on recovering assets embezzled by corrupt individuals both locally and abroad.\n",
      "Officials confirmed that these laundered funds are a key target in a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards.\n",
      "The statement revealed that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have siphoned off vast sums from the banking sector, laundering these funds through fraudulent activities. \"Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1 lakh crore, though the exact figure is still being determined,\" it said.\n",
      "Interim government Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has recently appealed to envoys from the UK and Switzerland for assistance in recovering the laundered funds.\n",
      "However, Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya, head of the White Paper Committee on the state of the country's economy, on Thursday acknowledged the daunting nature of the task. This is a very complex process, he told reporters after the committee’s first meeting. \"Tracking this money is not a simple matter at all.\"\n",
      "He explained that if the money is located, legal action must first be initiated under the host country’s laws. \"After obtaining a decree from the host country, it must then be presented in the destination country,” he said.\n",
      "Only after securing a decree from the destination country can the assets purchased with laundered money be frozen and sold to repatriate the funds.\n",
      "Dr. Debapriya also highlighted the need for solid, admissible documentation to support these legal efforts, stressing that identifying assets purchased with laundered money is a significant challenge.\n",
      "He noted that Bangladesh lacks the necessary treaties with many countries to facilitate the recovery of these funds and that the country does not have enough skilled lawyers and financial analysts to handle such cases effectively.\n",
      "Another prominent economist, who requested anonymity, told UNB that the Attorney General’s office must first establish the case of money laundering before sending a request to the country where the funds were smuggled. \"This is not a political issue and should be approached objectively,\" he said. \"It requires serious preparedness; otherwise, it risks being dismissed as mere political rhetoric.\"\n",
      "He outlined three critical aspects that need to be addressed: previous experiences, the capacity of the Attorney General’s office, and the involvement of foreign missions in international legal processes. \"All three areas must be prepared before attempting to recover the smuggled money,\" he added.\n",
      "Supreme Court Advocate, Barrister ARM Ahsanul Haq Khan, echoed these sentiments, stating that recovering the laundered money would be an extremely tough job for the government due to the many complexities involved.\n",
      "Strong political will is essential to initiate the process, followed by the coordinated efforts of the Bangladesh Bank, NBR, ACC, and the Attorney General’s office, along with the Home, Finance, and Foreign ministries, he said.\n",
      "He emphasized that Bangladesh would also need to secure agreements with the specific countries involved. \"While the government’s move is commendable, it is a very tough and challenging task for the interim government.\"\n",
      "To date, according to the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh has successfully recovered approximately 20.41 lakh Singapore dollars (equivalent to Tk 13 crore) in 2012, laundered by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko.\n",

      "The IMF extended $4.7 billion loan facility to Bangladesh in January last year to help support the dwindling economy, which has been facing severe crises since war broke out in Ukraine in 2022.\n",

      "Bangladesh needs to prioritise expanding its export markets before fully adopting local-currency settlements in external trade, according to a recent report by Bangladesh Bank (BB).\n",
      "The special study titled \"Trading in Local Currencies: Problems and Prospects for the SAARC Countries,\" was led by Dr. Sayera Younus, Executive Director (Research) at Bangladesh Bank.\n",
      "In mid-2023, Bangladesh and India initiated the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees (INR) to reduce over-dependence on the US dollar.\n",
      "However, insiders at the central bank indicated that the initiative is yet to gain significant traction among traders.\n",
      "On July 11 last year, India and Bangladesh officially launched cross-border trade settlements in Indian rupees as part of efforts to lessen reliance on the US dollar.\n",
      "Between July and December 2023, two banks facilitated transactions worth 3.51 million rupees which is much lower than the bilateral trade between the two countries.\n",
      "And, Bangladesh continues to face a huge trade deficit with India and encounters challenges in using the rupee, including high demand for US dollars and limited rupee earnings.\n",
      "The study report highlights that trading in local currencies can serve as an effective tool to promote cooperation within the SAARC region.\n",
      "However, the study emphasises the importance of regional initiatives, bilateral agreements, and private sector engagement to enhance local currency trade in SAARC.\n",
      "\"These measures aim to improve trading efficiency, reduce costs, and boost trade competitiveness and volumes by minimising currency conversion complexities,\" it notes.\n",
      "It also underscores the need to shift exporter and importer attitudes through educational initiatives and capacity building to encourage the use of local currencies.\n",
      "Additionally, the study stresses the importance of gradually relaxing capital flow restrictions to establish a secure trade settlement system.\n",
      "\"Tariff and non-tariff barriers among member countries should be reduced,\" the report suggests, adding that foreign exchange regulations should be adapted to promote the use of local and regional currencies in trade and investment.\n",

      "The United Kingdom (UK) has expressed their keen interest to help Bangladesh reform its banking and revenue sectors alongside the capital market.\n",
      "The interest surfaced as the UK High Commissioner to Bangladesh Sarah Cooke called on Finance Adviser to the interim government Dr Salehuddin Ahmed at his Economic Relations Division (ERD) office in the city on Tuesday.\n",
      "After the meeting, the finance adviser said the UK is willing to help Bangladesh reform sectors like banking, revenue and capital markets.\n",
      "\"Those are very immediate concerns for us also. Because, unless we carry out those reforms it would be difficult for us,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\n",
      "The adviser said they have discussed enhancement of trade and commerce between the two countries.\n",
      "\"We want that the trade and commerce should flourish. The UK government was very helpful in the past and I hope that they will be helpful in the coming days as well. We are looking forward to their help and cooperation,\" he said.\n",
      "The finance adviser and the British envoy also discussed the cooperation between Bangladesh and the UK.\n",
      "Dr Salehuddin mentioned that the UK is working mainly in economic development and women's empowerment, adding, \"We will continue those as well. Private sector investment is also very much important. Big business houses of Britain have invested here,\" he added.\n",
      "The adviser said that he told them to diversify the import items from Bangladesh as his country mainly exports RMG items to the UK and the European countries.\n",
      "He also said that Bangladesh will have to improve the business environment to attract more private investment.\n",
      "\"For that, the condition is to make business environment, ease doing business that means we have to fix the climate of doing business, otherwise private sector will not come,\" he said.\n",
      "Mentioning that the discussion was very fruitful, the British high commissioner said the UK and Bangladesh had a very strong economic, trade and investment relations.\n",
      "\"We're very keen to expand our trade and investment ties and we also discussed how the UK can support the economic reforms in Bangladesh that the adviser is leading and how we may jointly work to bring our experts together to discuss the issues of economic reform and also how we can boost our trade and investment ties between the two countries,\"\n",

      "All three diaspora bonds of the government have lost attractiveness to expatriates for low profit rates they yield, causing the negative investment growth of the instruments for the past three years.\n",
      "The negative growth in net sales of the state-backed bonds was Tk 19.13 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, Tk 20.06 billion in FY23 and Tk 13.95 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Of the bonds, according to the Department of National Savings (DNS), the Wage Earner Development Bond (WEDB) has a relatively high rate of return.\n",
      "It has negative growth too, as the largest investor, merchant mariners, cannot invest in this bond due to definition-related complications.\n",
      "The yield rate of the WEDB is highest at 12 per cent, the US Dollar Premium Bond at 7.50 per cent and the US Dollar Investment Bond at 6.50 per cent.\n",
      "However, these rates have further been changed into different slabs in January this year, such as above Tk 500,000, the rate is 4.0 per cent for investment bond and 5.0 per cent for premium bond on maturity.\n",
      "In the case of the WEDB, there will be a profit of 9.0 per cent for above Tk 5.0 million.\n",
      "Overall investment has dropped for the past two years. Expatriates' net investment on these three bonds was Tk 9.32 billion in FY21 and Tk 12.46 billion in FY20.\n",
      "The gross sales of the NRB (non-resident Bangladeshi) bonds were Tk 11.06 billion in FY24, Tk 11.72 billion in FY23 and Tk 9.83 billion in FY22.\n",
      "While sales of diaspora bonds are on the decrease, expatriates' investments in treasury bonds are increasing gradually.\n",
      "Tareq Muhammad Zakaria, deputy secretary (savings) at the Internal Resources Division (IRD), says expatriates are investing more in treasury bonds.\n",
      "The NRBs also have better investment options in their destination countries. For these reasons, investment in diaspora bonds is not increasing, he argues.\n",
      "The government is paying up to a 13-per cent yield on treasury bonds and up to 12 per cent on treasury bills.\n",
      "Statistics available with the Bangladesh Bank show monthly outstanding treasury bonds held by non-resident investors increased to Tk 7.55 billion in June 2024 from Tk 30 million in July 2023.\n",
      "DEFINITION COMPLEXITIES\n",
      "Merchant mariners are the largest customers of the WEDB. So far, they have appealed many times to resume the investment scope. The government has not given any solution to this end yet.\n",
      "Mariners, also known as seafarers who spend most of their lives on vessels, do not stay long in any country as they have to sail from port to port to perform professional duties.\n",
      "For this reason, they are not defined as remitters.\n",
      "Back in 2020, the IRD issued a notification barring merchant mariners from investing in the WEDB, an attractive scheme meant for them for good rates and a death-risk benefit.\n",
      "For this reason, the sailors, mostly educated and skilled workforce, have invested their hard-earned money abroad since 2020, while their native country faces a depletion of forex reserves.\n",
      "According to the IMF calculation, the forex reserve currently stands at $20.48 billion as of August 21.\n",
      "The seafarers, numbering more than 16,000, used to invest in the bond before 2020, says Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association (BMMOA) president Capt Md Anam Chowdhury.\n",
      "\"An estimated $600 million worth of their total income is now being invested outside of the country each year as they are currently not eligible to invest in the WEDB.\"\n",
      "The net negative growth of the WEDB was Tk 14.85 billion in FY24, Tk 16.11 billion in FY23 and Tk 4.15 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Investment in this bond has fallen for the past two years as well. The net investment was Tk 10.15 billion in FY21 and Tk 11.53 billion in FY20.\n",
      "BMMOA, the apex trade body of merchant mariners, has sent 12 letters to various government departments since 2020 requesting permission to purchase the wage-earner bond.\n",
      "They applied to the finance ministry on the 18th of this month.\n",
      "\"About 90-per cent of mariners are employed in contract ships and have no gratuity or pension benefits. The WEDB is the prime investment scheme for their earning source after retirement,\" cited the letter.\n",
      "\"Therefore, we strongly believe that the resumption of bond purchase facilities for mariners will increase the inflow of foreign exchange in the current critical situation of the country's foreign exchange reserve.\"\n",
      "The central bank in a letter also requested the IRD on 24 November 2022 to allow mariners and pilots to buy the bond to boost remittance inflow.\n",
      "UNWISE POLICY\n",
      "Economists say it is crucial to take initiatives to increase remittance flow in the country at this critical moment of foreign-exchange reserves.\n",
      "As Bangladesh has been facing a dollar dearth in recent years, the government should have adjusted the rates of dollar bonds to market rates, they said.\n",
      "Dr M Masrur Reaz, chairman of the Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, said since the rates of profits in other schemes, including treasury bonds, are high, the rates of NRB bonds should be fixed proportionally.\n",
      "\"Seafarers are earning US dollars, so why can't they buy NRB bonds?\" he pointed out, thereby suggesting the government come out of wrong policies, as the country is going through a remittance crisis.\n",
      "Mr Reaz feels that other remittance earners should also be allowed to invest in NRB bonds to help boost foreign-currency reserves.\n",
      "Prof Dr Muinul Islam, former chairperson at the Department of Economics at Chattogram University, also suggested allowing sailors to buy the WEDB.\n",
      "When asked, he said Bangladeshi migrants should primarily be encouraged to remit through formal channels. Then they might be motivated to invest in these bonds as well.\n",

      "Distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Professor Dr Mustafizur Rahman has said the prices of essential commodities have increased by at least 50 per cent in the last two years.\n",
      "He came up with the statement while addressing a debate competition organised by Debate For Democracy at Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) on Saturday.\n",
      "“It is very difficult to determine the price hike through the average inflation rate. The price of an item worth Tk 100 has now increased to Tk 150. Although the average inflation is said to be 10 to 12 per cent, prices of essential commodities have increased by at least 50 per cent,” Dr Mustafizur Rahman said.\n",
      "The economist said although the recent successful movement was started for job quota reformation, the economic discrimination ensured the participation of all sections of people in the protests.\n",

      "The Bangladesh Bank is set to announce a decision to raise interest rates from 8.5 per cent to 9.0 per cent in a day or two, Governor Ahsan H Mansur said.\n",
      "In an interview with BBC at the central bank’s offices in Dhaka on Wednesday, Mansur said he would raise rates further to 10 per cent or more in the coming months to tame inflation.\n",
      "The country’s average inflation rose to 11.66 per cent in July, the first month of the fiscal year 2024-25. A month ago, the inflation rate had come down to single digits in June, reports bdnews24.com.\n",
      "AH Mahmood Ali, former finance minister of the Sheikh Hasina government ousted by a mass movement, had aspirations for a sizable improvement in the new fiscal year despite the high inflation rates over the past two years.\n",
      "He also set an ambitious target for the current fiscal year. In the budget speech, he spoke about the goal of keeping the country's average inflation rate at 6.5 per cent in the budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n",
      "However, the ambitious target was thwarted when the student movement demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs started at the beginning of the current fiscal year.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had asked Bangladesh to tighten its monetary policy and keep exchange rates flexible while extending a $4.7 billion bailout for Bangladesh.\n",
      "Mansur told the BBC that he was in conversation with the body to \"augment\" and \"front load\" this amount by an additional $3.0 billion.\n",
      "Bangladesh was also seeking an additional $1.5 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion each from the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, he said.\n",

      "Bangladesh Bank and the interim government are undertaking significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, focusing on recovering both local and foreign assets embezzled by corrupt individuals.\n",
      "Officials have confirmed that these assets, laundered abroad, are being targeted for repatriation as part of a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards, reports UNB.\n",
      "The government emphasized its commitment to reforming the financial sector, acknowledging that the process is complex and time-consuming.\n",
      "A key element of this strategy will be the establishment of a banking commission tasked with investigating each implicated bank, uncovering the full extent of the corruption, and developing an action plan, according to the Chief Adviser’s press wing.\n",
      "This plan, which can be implemented within six months, aims to overhaul the sector to ensure compliance with global banking norms.\n",
      "The aim of Bangladesh Bank and the government is to be capable of complying with all international standards and building a strong banking sector.\n",
      "However, international technical assistance and funding will be required from the beginning to the end of the activities to achieve this objective.\n",
      "The reforms come in response to revelations that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have embezzled vast sums from the banking sector, laundering the funds abroad through fraudulent activities.\n",
      "Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1.0 trillion, though the exact figure is still being determined.\n",
      "Significant steps have already been taken, with reforms initiated in several banks linked to the scandal.\n",
      "The boards of Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, National Bank, United Commercial Bank, Global Islami Bank, and Union Bank have been reconstituted as part of the restructuring efforts. Similar measures will be implemented across other affected banks and financial institutions.\n",
      "The government has also sought assistance from foreign agencies to track and repatriate the laundered funds. As the new management teams take control, they will be responsible for gathering accurate data on the embezzled amounts and leading the recovery efforts.\n",

      "Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Dr Fahmida Khatun said the list for the interim government for immediate and midterm measures is long but some of the measures have to start during its term.\n",
      "She said the measures taken by the interim government should be carried out by the next government also when the new elected government comes.\n",
      "“But the initiatives have to be taken now, and this is the time,” she said while speaking at a webinar, noting that the challenges for the interim government are humongous.\n",
      "The economist said first of all, the interim government has to ensure political stability and also restore law and order situation because these are preconditions for economic prosperity and economic growth.\n",
      "She said the political turmoil which they have observed, during the student-led movement and also some of the actions by the previous government like Internet blackout, have an impact on the economy in the immediate term, and it will also have an impact in the medium term.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said these challenges are very difficult to deal with within limited time.\n",
      "She said the economy observed a reasonable rate of growth but there was a lack of authenticity of data during the past regime and the numbers were inflated as those were far from reality.\n",
      "“I have written earlier, that Bangladesh's growth story lacks justice and humanity, and this, I described from the point of the distributional aspect of the growth and the qualitative part of the growth,” she said, adding that that is why the student movement for quota reform was the manifestation of bigger problems that policymakers had overlooked for decades.\n",
      "In fact, Dr Fahmida said, the economy now requires reforms and there is a need for institutional reforms to bring discipline to the economic system.\n",
      "She said the corruption model which has been created over the decades, has benefited certain groups which she has mentioned by depriving the larger sections of the people.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida observed how the political turmoil in Bangladesh during the student-led mass uprising in July and August led to the collapse of the government on 5th August 2024.\n",
      "“So with this change, the interim government has to work on almost every front to fulfil the ambition of the students and people of the country. This is extremely challenging as the system has almost collapsed during the last 15 years,” she said.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said the challenges on the economic front are formidable. Some of these challenges include high inflation, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, inefficiency and corruption in public projects implementation, low tax GDP ratio, low private and foreign investment, a weak financial sector, high nonperforming loans in the banking sector, illicit financial outflow, unemployment, and also poverty and inequality.\n",
      "Right to Freedom Board Member Jon Danilowicz moderated the webinar while Right to Freedom Executive Director Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey gave a brief introduction of the panel of speakers and Ambassador (retd) William B Milam, Board President of the R2F offered opening remarks.\n",
      "Director of the South Asia Institute at Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Michael Kugelman and Secretary, Citizens for Good Governance Dr. Badiul Alam Mazumdar spoke at the webinar which aimed to foster conversations on critical aspects of Bangladesh’s new journey under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus.\n",

      "Despite the interim government’s strong commitment to recover money laundered out of Bangladesh, experts say that the process will be challenging and complicated, reports UNB.\n",
      "A recent press statement from the Chief Adviser’s Office highlighted the government and Bangladesh Bank’s significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, with a particular focus on recovering assets embezzled by corrupt individuals both locally and abroad.\n",
      "Officials confirmed that these laundered funds are a key target in a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards.\n",
      "The statement revealed that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have siphoned off vast sums from the banking sector, laundering these funds through fraudulent activities. \"Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1 lakh crore, though the exact figure is still being determined,\" it said.\n",
      "Interim government Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has recently appealed to envoys from the UK and Switzerland for assistance in recovering the laundered funds.\n",
      "However, Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya, head of the White Paper Committee on the state of the country's economy, on Thursday acknowledged the daunting nature of the task. This is a very complex process, he told reporters after the committee’s first meeting. \"Tracking this money is not a simple matter at all.\"\n",
      "He explained that if the money is located, legal action must first be initiated under the host country’s laws. \"After obtaining a decree from the host country, it must then be presented in the destination country,” he said.\n",
      "Only after securing a decree from the destination country can the assets purchased with laundered money be frozen and sold to repatriate the funds.\n",
      "Dr. Debapriya also highlighted the need for solid, admissible documentation to support these legal efforts, stressing that identifying assets purchased with laundered money is a significant challenge.\n",
      "He noted that Bangladesh lacks the necessary treaties with many countries to facilitate the recovery of these funds and that the country does not have enough skilled lawyers and financial analysts to handle such cases effectively.\n",
      "Another prominent economist, who requested anonymity, told UNB that the Attorney General’s office must first establish the case of money laundering before sending a request to the country where the funds were smuggled. \"This is not a political issue and should be approached objectively,\" he said. \"It requires serious preparedness; otherwise, it risks being dismissed as mere political rhetoric.\"\n",
      "He outlined three critical aspects that need to be addressed: previous experiences, the capacity of the Attorney General’s office, and the involvement of foreign missions in international legal processes. \"All three areas must be prepared before attempting to recover the smuggled money,\" he added.\n",
      "Supreme Court Advocate, Barrister ARM Ahsanul Haq Khan, echoed these sentiments, stating that recovering the laundered money would be an extremely tough job for the government due to the many complexities involved.\n",
      "Strong political will is essential to initiate the process, followed by the coordinated efforts of the Bangladesh Bank, NBR, ACC, and the Attorney General’s office, along with the Home, Finance, and Foreign ministries, he said.\n",
      "He emphasized that Bangladesh would also need to secure agreements with the specific countries involved. \"While the government’s move is commendable, it is a very tough and challenging task for the interim government.\"\n",
      "To date, according to the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh has successfully recovered approximately 20.41 lakh Singapore dollars (equivalent to Tk 13 crore) in 2012, laundered by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko.\n",

      "Bangladesh needs to prioritise expanding its export markets before fully adopting local-currency settlements in external trade, according to a recent report by Bangladesh Bank (BB).\n",
      "The special study titled \"Trading in Local Currencies: Problems and Prospects for the SAARC Countries,\" was led by Dr. Sayera Younus, Executive Director (Research) at Bangladesh Bank.\n",
      "In mid-2023, Bangladesh and India initiated the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees (INR) to reduce over-dependence on the US dollar.\n",
      "However, insiders at the central bank indicated that the initiative is yet to gain significant traction among traders.\n",
      "On July 11 last year, India and Bangladesh officially launched cross-border trade settlements in Indian rupees as part of efforts to lessen reliance on the US dollar.\n",
      "Between July and December 2023, two banks facilitated transactions worth 3.51 million rupees which is much lower than the bilateral trade between the two countries.\n",
      "And, Bangladesh continues to face a huge trade deficit with India and encounters challenges in using the rupee, including high demand for US dollars and limited rupee earnings.\n",
      "The study report highlights that trading in local currencies can serve as an effective tool to promote cooperation within the SAARC region.\n",
      "However, the study emphasises the importance of regional initiatives, bilateral agreements, and private sector engagement to enhance local currency trade in SAARC.\n",
      "\"These measures aim to improve trading efficiency, reduce costs, and boost trade competitiveness and volumes by minimising currency conversion complexities,\" it notes.\n",
      "It also underscores the need to shift exporter and importer attitudes through educational initiatives and capacity building to encourage the use of local currencies.\n",
      "Additionally, the study stresses the importance of gradually relaxing capital flow restrictions to establish a secure trade settlement system.\n",
      "\"Tariff and non-tariff barriers among member countries should be reduced,\" the report suggests, adding that foreign exchange regulations should be adapted to promote the use of local and regional currencies in trade and investment.\n",

      "\"We want that the trade and commerce should flourish. The UK government was very helpful in the past and I hope that they will be helpful in the coming days as well. We are looking forward to their help and cooperation,\" he said.\n",
      "The finance adviser and the British envoy also discussed the cooperation between Bangladesh and the UK.\n",
      "Dr Salehuddin mentioned that the UK is working mainly in economic development and women's empowerment, adding, \"We will continue those as well. Private sector investment is also very much important. Big business houses of Britain have invested here,\" he added.\n",
      "The adviser said that he told them to diversify the import items from Bangladesh as his country mainly exports RMG items to the UK and the European countries.\n",
      "He also said that Bangladesh will have to improve the business environment to attract more private investment.\n",
      "\"For that, the condition is to make business environment, ease doing business that means we have to fix the climate of doing business, otherwise private sector will not come,\" he said.\n",
      "Mentioning that the discussion was very fruitful, the British high commissioner said the UK and Bangladesh had a very strong economic, trade and investment relations.\n",
      "\"We're very keen to expand our trade and investment ties and we also discussed how the UK can support the economic reforms in Bangladesh that the adviser is leading and how we may jointly work to bring our experts together to discuss the issues of economic reform and also how we can boost our trade and investment ties between the two countries,\"\n",
      "Responding to a question on mobilizing more FDI from the UK, she said that the UK has a very strong partnership with Bangladesh.\n",
      "\"We've a very strong and investment environment. Off course, we would like to see more FDI into Bangladesh,\" she added.\n",
      "The envoy said the British investors for sure are responsible investors, adding, \"I discussed with the adviser how we can build investors' confidence and strengthen our trade and investment ties.\"\n",
      "Replying to another question, Sarah Cooke said she also discussed the economic reforms that Bangladesh was prioritizing and how the UK can support Bangladesh in this regard.\n",

      "All three diaspora bonds of the government have lost attractiveness to expatriates for low profit rates they yield, causing the negative investment growth of the instruments for the past three years.\n",
      "The negative growth in net sales of the state-backed bonds was Tk 19.13 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, Tk 20.06 billion in FY23 and Tk 13.95 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Of the bonds, according to the Department of National Savings (DNS), the Wage Earner Development Bond (WEDB) has a relatively high rate of return.\n",
      "It has negative growth too, as the largest investor, merchant mariners, cannot invest in this bond due to definition-related complications.\n",
      "The yield rate of the WEDB is highest at 12 per cent, the US Dollar Premium Bond at 7.50 per cent and the US Dollar Investment Bond at 6.50 per cent.\n",
      "However, these rates have further been changed into different slabs in January this year, such as above Tk 500,000, the rate is 4.0 per cent for investment bond and 5.0 per cent for premium bond on maturity.\n",
      "In the case of the WEDB, there will be a profit of 9.0 per cent for above Tk 5.0 million.\n",
      "Overall investment has dropped for the past two years. Expatriates' net investment on these three bonds was Tk 9.32 billion in FY21 and Tk 12.46 billion in FY20.\n",
      "The gross sales of the NRB (non-resident Bangladeshi) bonds were Tk 11.06 billion in FY24, Tk 11.72 billion in FY23 and Tk 9.83 billion in FY22.\n",
      "While sales of diaspora bonds are on the decrease, expatriates' investments in treasury bonds are increasing gradually.\n",
      "Tareq Muhammad Zakaria, deputy secretary (savings) at the Internal Resources Division (IRD), says expatriates are investing more in treasury bonds.\n",
      "The NRBs also have better investment options in their destination countries. For these reasons, investment in diaspora bonds is not increasing, he argues.\n",
      "The government is paying up to a 13-per cent yield on treasury bonds and up to 12 per cent on treasury bills.\n",
      "Statistics available with the Bangladesh Bank show monthly outstanding treasury bonds held by non-resident investors increased to Tk 7.55 billion in June 2024 from Tk 30 million in July 2023.\n",
      "DEFINITION COMPLEXITIES\n",
      "Merchant mariners are the largest customers of the WEDB. So far, they have appealed many times to resume the investment scope. The government has not given any solution to this end yet.\n",
      "Mariners, also known as seafarers who spend most of their lives on vessels, do not stay long in any country as they have to sail from port to port to perform professional duties.\n",
      "For this reason, they are not defined as remitters.\n",
      "Back in 2020, the IRD issued a notification barring merchant mariners from investing in the WEDB, an attractive scheme meant for them for good rates and a death-risk benefit.\n",
      "For this reason, the sailors, mostly educated and skilled workforce, have invested their hard-earned money abroad since 2020, while their native country faces a depletion of forex reserves.\n",
      "According to the IMF calculation, the forex reserve currently stands at $20.48 billion as of August 21.\n",
      "The seafarers, numbering more than 16,000, used to invest in the bond before 2020, says Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association (BMMOA) president Capt Md Anam Chowdhury.\n",
      "\"An estimated $600 million worth of their total income is now being invested outside of the country each year as they are currently not eligible to invest in the WEDB.\"\n",
      "The net negative growth of the WEDB was Tk 14.85 billion in FY24, Tk 16.11 billion in FY23 and Tk 4.15 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Investment in this bond has fallen for the past two years as well. The net investment was Tk 10.15 billion in FY21 and Tk 11.53 billion in FY20.\n",
      "BMMOA, the apex trade body of merchant mariners, has sent 12 letters to various government departments since 2020 requesting permission to purchase the wage-earner bond.\n",
      "They applied to the finance ministry on the 18th of this month.\n",
      "\"About 90-per cent of mariners are employed in contract ships and have no gratuity or pension benefits. The WEDB is the prime investment scheme for their earning source after retirement,\" cited the letter.\n",
      "\"Therefore, we strongly believe that the resumption of bond purchase facilities for mariners will increase the inflow of foreign exchange in the current critical situation of the country's foreign exchange reserve.\"\n",
      "The central bank in a letter also requested the IRD on 24 November 2022 to allow mariners and pilots to buy the bond to boost remittance inflow.\n",
      "UNWISE POLICY\n",
      "Economists say it is crucial to take initiatives to increase remittance flow in the country at this critical moment of foreign-exchange reserves.\n",
      "As Bangladesh has been facing a dollar dearth in recent years, the government should have adjusted the rates of dollar bonds to market rates, they said.\n",
      "Dr M Masrur Reaz, chairman of the Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, said since the rates of profits in other schemes, including treasury bonds, are high, the rates of NRB bonds should be fixed proportionally.\n",
      "\"Seafarers are earning US dollars, so why can't they buy NRB bonds?\" he pointed out, thereby suggesting the government come out of wrong policies, as the country is going through a remittance crisis.\n",
      "Mr Reaz feels that other remittance earners should also be allowed to invest in NRB bonds to help boost foreign-currency reserves.\n",
      "Prof Dr Muinul Islam, former chairperson at the Department of Economics at Chattogram University, also suggested allowing sailors to buy the WEDB.\n",
      "When asked, he said Bangladeshi migrants should primarily be encouraged to remit through formal channels. Then they might be motivated to invest in these bonds as well.\n",

      "“It is very difficult to determine the price hike through the average inflation rate. The price of an item worth Tk 100 has now increased to Tk 150.

      "In an interview with BBC at the central bank’s offices in Dhaka on Wednesday, Mansur said he would raise rates further to 10 per cent or more in the coming months to tame inflation.\n",
      "The country’s average inflation rose to 11.66 per cent in July, the first month of the fiscal year 2024-25. A month ago, the inflation rate had come down to single digits in June, reports bdnews24.com.\n",
      "AH Mahmood Ali, former finance minister of the Sheikh Hasina government ousted by a mass movement, had aspirations for a sizable improvement in the new fiscal year despite the high inflation rates over the past two years.\n",
      "He also set an ambitious target for the current fiscal year. In the budget speech, he spoke about the goal of keeping the country's average inflation rate at 6.5 per cent in the budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n",
      "However, the ambitious target was thwarted when the student movement demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs started at the beginning of the current fiscal year.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had asked Bangladesh to tighten its monetary policy and keep exchange rates flexible while extending a $4.7 billion bailout for Bangladesh.\n",

      "Bangladesh Bank and the interim government are undertaking significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, focusing on recovering both local and foreign assets embezzled by corrupt individuals.\n",
      "Officials have confirmed that these assets, laundered abroad, are being targeted for repatriation as part of a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards, reports UNB.\n",
      "The government emphasized its commitment to reforming the financial sector, acknowledging that the process is complex and time-consuming.\n",
      "A key element of this strategy will be the establishment of a banking commission tasked with investigating each implicated bank, uncovering the full extent of the corruption, and developing an action plan, according to the Chief Adviser’s press wing.\n",
      "This plan, which can be implemented within six months, aims to overhaul the sector to ensure compliance with global banking norms.\n",
      "The aim of Bangladesh Bank and the government is to be capable of complying with all international standards and building a strong banking sector.\n",
      "However, international technical assistance and funding will be required from the beginning to the end of the activities to achieve this objective.\n",
      "The reforms come in response to revelations that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have embezzled vast sums from the banking sector, laundering the funds abroad through fraudulent activities.\n",
      "Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1.0 trillion, though the exact figure is still being determined.\n",
      "Significant steps have already been taken, with reforms initiated in several banks linked to the scandal.\n",
      "The boards of Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, National Bank, United Commercial Bank, Global Islami Bank, and Union Bank have been reconstituted as part of the restructuring efforts. Similar measures will be implemented across other affected banks and financial institutions.\n",
      "The government has also sought assistance from foreign agencies to track and repatriate the laundered funds. As the new management teams take control, they will be responsible for gathering accurate data on the embezzled amounts and leading the recovery efforts.\n",

      "Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Dr Fahmida Khatun said the list for the interim government for immediate and midterm measures is long but some of the measures have to start during its term.\n",
      "She said the measures taken by the interim government should be carried out by the next government also when the new elected government comes.\n",
      "“But the initiatives have to be taken now, and this is the time,” she said while speaking at a webinar, noting that the challenges for the interim government are humongous.\n",
      "The economist said first of all, the interim government has to ensure political stability and also restore law and order situation because these are preconditions for economic prosperity and economic growth.\n",
      "She said the political turmoil which they have observed, during the student-led movement and also some of the actions by the previous government like Internet blackout, have an impact on the economy in the immediate term, and it will also have an impact in the medium term.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said these challenges are very difficult to deal with within limited time.\n",
      "She said the economy observed a reasonable rate of growth but there was a lack of authenticity of data during the past regime and the numbers were inflated as those were far from reality.\n",
      "“I have written earlier, that Bangladesh's growth story lacks justice and humanity, and this, I described from the point of the distributional aspect of the growth and the qualitative part of the growth,” she said, adding that that is why the student movement for quota reform was the manifestation of bigger problems that policymakers had overlooked for decades.\n",
      "In fact, Dr Fahmida said, the economy now requires reforms and there is a need for institutional reforms to bring discipline to the economic system.\n",
      "She said the corruption model which has been created over the decades, has benefited certain groups which she has mentioned by depriving the larger sections of the people.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida observed how the political turmoil in Bangladesh during the student-led mass uprising in July and August led to the collapse of the government on 5th August 2024.\n",
      "“So with this change, the interim government has to work on almost every front to fulfil the ambition of the students and people of the country. This is extremely challenging as the system has almost collapsed during the last 15 years,” she said.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said the challenges on the economic front are formidable. Some of these challenges include high inflation, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, inefficiency and corruption in public projects implementation, low tax GDP ratio, low private and foreign investment, a weak financial sector, high nonperforming loans in the banking sector, illicit financial outflow, unemployment, and also poverty and inequality.\n",
      "Right to Freedom Board Member Jon Danilowicz moderated the webinar while Right to Freedom Executive Director Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey gave a brief introduction of the panel of speakers and Ambassador (retd) William B Milam, Board President of the R2F offered opening remarks.\n",
      "Director of the South Asia Institute at Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.

      "Despite the interim government’s strong commitment to recover money laundered out of Bangladesh, experts say that the process will be challenging and complicated, reports UNB.\n",
      "A recent press statement from the Chief Adviser’s Office highlighted the government and Bangladesh Bank’s significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, with a particular focus on recovering assets embezzled by corrupt individuals both locally and abroad.\n",
      "Officials confirmed that these laundered funds are a key target in a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards.\n",
      "The statement revealed that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have siphoned off vast sums from the banking sector, laundering these funds through fraudulent activities. \"Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1 lakh crore, though the exact figure is still being determined,\" it said.\n",
      "Interim government Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has recently appealed to envoys from the UK and Switzerland for assistance in recovering the laundered funds.\n",
      "However, Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya, head of the White Paper Committee on the state of the country's economy, on Thursday acknowledged the daunting nature of the task. This is a very complex process, he told reporters after the committee’s first meeting. \"Tracking this money is not a simple matter at all.\"\n",
      "He explained that if the money is located, legal action must first be initiated under the host country’s laws. \"After obtaining a decree from the host country, it must then be presented in the destination country,” he said.\n",
      "Only after securing a decree from the destination country can the assets purchased with laundered money be frozen and sold to repatriate the funds.\n",
      "Dr. Debapriya also highlighted the need for solid, admissible documentation to support these legal efforts, stressing that identifying assets purchased with laundered money is a significant challenge.\n",
      "He noted that Bangladesh lacks the necessary treaties with many countries to facilitate the recovery of these funds and that the country does not have enough skilled lawyers and financial analysts to handle such cases effectively.\n",
      "Another prominent economist, who requested anonymity, told UNB that the Attorney General’s office must first establish the case of money laundering before sending a request to the country where the funds were smuggled. \"This is not a political issue and should be approached objectively,\" he said. \"It requires serious preparedness; otherwise, it risks being dismissed as mere political rhetoric.\"\n",
      "He outlined three critical aspects that need to be addressed: previous experiences, the capacity of the Attorney General’s office, and the involvement of foreign missions in international legal processes. \"All three areas must be prepared before attempting to recover the smuggled money,\" he added.\n",
      "Supreme Court Advocate, Barrister ARM Ahsanul Haq Khan, echoed these sentiments, stating that recovering the laundered money would be an extremely tough job for the government due to the many complexities involved.\n",
      "Strong political will is essential to initiate the process, followed by the coordinated efforts of the Bangladesh Bank, NBR, ACC, and the Attorney General’s office, along with the Home, Finance, and Foreign ministries, he said.\n",
      "He emphasized that Bangladesh would also need to secure agreements with the specific countries involved. \"While the government’s move is commendable, it is a very tough and challenging task for the interim government.\"\n",
      "To date, according to the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh has successfully recovered approximately 20.41 lakh Singapore dollars (equivalent to Tk 13 crore) in 2012, laundered by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko.\n",

      "Bangladesh needs to prioritise expanding its export markets before fully adopting local-currency settlements in external trade, according to a recent report by Bangladesh Bank (BB).\n",
      "The special study titled \"Trading in Local Currencies: Problems and Prospects for the SAARC Countries,\" was led by Dr. Sayera Younus, Executive Director (Research) at Bangladesh Bank.\n",
      "In mid-2023, Bangladesh and India initiated the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees (INR) to reduce over-dependence on the US dollar.\n",
      "However, insiders at the central bank indicated that the initiative is yet to gain significant traction among traders.\n",
      "On July 11 last year, India and Bangladesh officially launched cross-border trade settlements in Indian rupees as part of efforts to lessen reliance on the US dollar.\n",
      "Between July and December 2023, two banks facilitated transactions worth 3.51 million rupees which is much lower than the bilateral trade between the two countries.\n",
      "And, Bangladesh continues to face a huge trade deficit with India and encounters challenges in using the rupee, including high demand for US dollars and limited rupee earnings.\n",
      "The study report highlights that trading in local currencies can serve as an effective tool to promote cooperation within the SAARC region.\n",
      "However, the study emphasises the importance of regional initiatives, bilateral agreements, and private sector engagement to enhance local currency trade in SAARC.\n",
      "\"These measures aim to improve trading efficiency, reduce costs, and boost trade competitiveness and volumes by minimising currency conversion complexities,\" it notes.\n",
      "It also underscores the need to shift exporter and importer attitudes through educational initiatives and capacity building to encourage the use of local currencies.\n",
      "Additionally, the study stresses the importance of gradually relaxing capital flow restrictions to establish a secure trade settlement system.\n",
      "\"Tariff and non-tariff barriers among member countries should be reduced,\" the report suggests, adding that foreign exchange regulations should be adapted to promote the use of local and regional currencies in trade and investment.\n",

      "After the meeting, the finance adviser said the UK is willing to help Bangladesh reform sectors like banking, revenue and capital markets.\n",
      "\"Those are very immediate concerns for us also. Because, unless we carry out those reforms it would be difficult for us,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\n",
      "The adviser said they have discussed enhancement of trade and commerce between the two countries.\n",

      "The adviser said that he told them to diversify the import items from Bangladesh as his country mainly exports RMG items to the UK and the European countries.\n",

      "All three diaspora bonds of the government have lost attractiveness to expatriates for low profit rates they yield, causing the negative investment growth of the instruments for the past three years.\n",
      "The negative growth in net sales of the state-backed bonds was Tk 19.13 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, Tk 20.06 billion in FY23 and Tk 13.95 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Of the bonds, according to the Department of National Savings (DNS), the Wage Earner Development Bond (WEDB) has a relatively high rate of return.\n",
      "It has negative growth too, as the largest investor, merchant mariners, cannot invest in this bond due to definition-related complications.\n",
      "The yield rate of the WEDB is highest at 12 per cent, the US Dollar Premium Bond at 7.50 per cent and the US Dollar Investment Bond at 6.50 per cent.\n",
      "However, these rates have further been changed into different slabs in January this year, such as above Tk 500,000, the rate is 4.0 per cent for investment bond and 5.0 per cent for premium bond on maturity.\n",
      "In the case of the WEDB, there will be a profit of 9.0 per cent for above Tk 5.0 million.\n",
      "Overall investment has dropped for the past two years. Expatriates' net investment on these three bonds was Tk 9.32 billion in FY21 and Tk 12.46 billion in FY20.\n",
      "The gross sales of the NRB (non-resident Bangladeshi) bonds were Tk 11.06 billion in FY24, Tk 11.72 billion in FY23 and Tk 9.83 billion in FY22.\n",
      "While sales of diaspora bonds are on the decrease, expatriates' investments in treasury bonds are increasing gradually.\n",
      "Tareq Muhammad Zakaria, deputy secretary (savings) at the Internal Resources Division (IRD), says expatriates are investing more in treasury bonds.\n",
      "The NRBs also have better investment options in their destination countries. For these reasons, investment in diaspora bonds is not increasing, he argues.\n",
      "The government is paying up to a 13-per cent yield on treasury bonds and up to 12 per cent on treasury bills.\n",
      "Statistics available with the Bangladesh Bank show monthly outstanding treasury bonds held by non-resident investors increased to Tk 7.55 billion in June 2024 from Tk 30 million in July 2023.\n",
      "DEFINITION COMPLEXITIES\n",
      "Merchant mariners are the largest customers of the WEDB. So far, they have appealed many times to resume the investment scope. The government has not given any solution to this end yet.\n",
      "Mariners, also known as seafarers who spend most of their lives on vessels, do not stay long in any country as they have to sail from port to port to perform professional duties.\n",
      "For this reason, they are not defined as remitters.\n",
      "Back in 2020, the IRD issued a notification barring merchant mariners from investing in the WEDB, an attractive scheme meant for them for good rates and a death-risk benefit.\n",
      "For this reason, the sailors, mostly educated and skilled workforce, have invested their hard-earned money abroad since 2020, while their native country faces a depletion of forex reserves.\n",
      "According to the IMF calculation, the forex reserve currently stands at $20.48 billion as of August 21.\n",
      "The seafarers, numbering more than 16,000, used to invest in the bond before 2020, says Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association (BMMOA) president Capt Md Anam Chowdhury.\n",
      "\"An estimated $600 million worth of their total income is now being invested outside of the country each year as they are currently not eligible to invest in the WEDB.\"\n",
      "The net negative growth of the WEDB was Tk 14.85 billion in FY24, Tk 16.11 billion in FY23 and Tk 4.15 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Investment in this bond has fallen for the past two years as well. The net investment was Tk 10.15 billion in FY21 and Tk 11.53 billion in FY20.\n",
      "BMMOA, the apex trade body of merchant mariners, has sent 12 letters to various government departments since 2020 requesting permission to purchase the wage-earner bond.\n",
      "They applied to the finance ministry on the 18th of this month.\n",
      "\"About 90-per cent of mariners are employed in contract ships and have no gratuity or pension benefits. The WEDB is the prime investment scheme for their earning source after retirement,\" cited the letter.\n",
      "\"Therefore, we strongly believe that the resumption of bond purchase facilities for mariners will increase the inflow of foreign exchange in the current critical situation of the country's foreign exchange reserve.\"\n",
      "The central bank in a letter also requested the IRD on 24 November 2022 to allow mariners and pilots to buy the bond to boost remittance inflow.\n",
      "UNWISE POLICY\n",
      "Economists say it is crucial to take initiatives to increase remittance flow in the country at this critical moment of foreign-exchange reserves.\n",
      "As Bangladesh has been facing a dollar dearth in recent years, the government should have adjusted the rates of dollar bonds to market rates, they said.\n",
      "Dr M Masrur Reaz, chairman of the Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, said since the rates of profits in other schemes, including treasury bonds, are high, the rates of NRB bonds should be fixed proportionally.\n",
      "\"Seafarers are earning US dollars, so why can't they buy NRB bonds?\" he pointed out, thereby suggesting the government come out of wrong policies, as the country is going through a remittance crisis.\n",
      "Mr Reaz feels that other remittance earners should also be allowed to invest in NRB bonds to help boost foreign-currency reserves.\n",
      "Prof Dr Muinul Islam, former chairperson at the Department of Economics at Chattogram University, also suggested allowing sailors to buy the WEDB.\n",
      "When asked, he said Bangladeshi migrants should primarily be encouraged to remit through formal channels. Then they might be motivated to invest in these bonds as well.\n",

      "The central bank has hiked the limit once in each of the previous three weeks, which it imposed after the deterioration of the law and order and overall security situation in the country since the fall of the Awami League government on August 5.\n",
      "Initially, the BB slapped the restriction on withdrawals of over Tk 0.10 million as banks were facing challenges in transferring cash from one place to another.\n",
      "Earlier the central bank instructed commercial banks to monitor transactions through cheques and block any suspicious transfer of funds.\n",

      "“It is very difficult to determine the price hike through the average inflation rate. The price of an item worth Tk 100 has now increased to Tk 150. Although the average inflation is said to be 10 to 12 per cent, prices of essential commodities have increased by at least 50 per cent,” Dr Mustafizur Rahman said.\n",

      "Body : \n",
      "The Bangladesh Bank is set to announce a decision to raise interest rates from 8.5 per cent to 9.0 per cent in a day or two, Governor Ahsan H Mansur said.\n",
      "In an interview with BBC at the central bank’s offices in Dhaka on Wednesday, Mansur said he would raise rates further to 10 per cent or more in the coming months to tame inflation.\n",
      "The country’s average inflation rose to 11.66 per cent in July, the first month of the fiscal year 2024-25. A month ago, the inflation rate had come down to single digits in June, reports bdnews24.com.\n",
      "AH Mahmood Ali, former finance minister of the Sheikh Hasina government ousted by a mass movement, had aspirations for a sizable improvement in the new fiscal year despite the high inflation rates over the past two years.\n",
      "He also set an ambitious target for the current fiscal year. In the budget speech, he spoke about the goal of keeping the country's average inflation rate at 6.5 per cent in the budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n",
      "However, the ambitious target was thwarted when the student movement demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs started at the beginning of the current fiscal year.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had asked Bangladesh to tighten its monetary policy and keep exchange rates flexible while extending a $4.7 billion bailout for Bangladesh.\n",
      "Mansur told the BBC that he was in conversation with the body to \"augment\" and \"front load\" this amount by an additional $3.0 billion.\n",
      "Bangladesh was also seeking an additional $1.5 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion each from the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, he said.\n",

      "Bangladesh Bank and the interim government are undertaking significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, focusing on recovering both local and foreign assets embezzled by corrupt individuals.\n",
      "Officials have confirmed that these assets, laundered abroad, are being targeted for repatriation as part of a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards, reports UNB.\n",
      "The government emphasized its commitment to reforming the financial sector, acknowledging that the process is complex and time-consuming.\n",
      "A key element of this strategy will be the establishment of a banking commission tasked with investigating each implicated bank, uncovering the full extent of the corruption, and developing an action plan, according to the Chief Adviser’s press wing.\n",
      "This plan, which can be implemented within six months, aims to overhaul the sector to ensure compliance with global banking norms.\n",
      "The aim of Bangladesh Bank and the government is to be capable of complying with all international standards and building a strong banking sector.\n",
      "However, international technical assistance and funding will be required from the beginning to the end of the activities to achieve this objective.\n",
      "The reforms come in response to revelations that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have embezzled vast sums from the banking sector, laundering the funds abroad through fraudulent activities.\n",
      "Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1.0 trillion, though the exact figure is still being determined.\n",
      "Significant steps have already been taken, with reforms initiated in several banks linked to the scandal.\n",
      "The boards of Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, National Bank, United Commercial Bank, Global Islami Bank, and Union Bank have been reconstituted as part of the restructuring efforts. Similar measures will be implemented across other affected banks and financial institutions.\n",
      "The government has also sought assistance from foreign agencies to track and repatriate the laundered funds. As the new management teams take control, they will be responsible for gathering accurate data on the embezzled amounts and leading the recovery efforts.\n",

      "Export data for the last fiscal year have been reconciled and will be published soon, along with impact of any calculation mismatch on the country's growth arithmetic.\n",
      "Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed Monday said the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) reconciled the export data to bridge the gap between calculations by two agencies.\n",
      "\"We have discussed the issue. There was mismatch between the export data of EPB and the ASYCUDA data of the National Board of Revenue. I have also asked the EPB to make a projection,\" he said briefing newsmen after a meeting with a delegation of the EPB at his secretariat office.\n",
      "He said from now on the ASYCUDA data would be the main source for export figure.\n",
      "Asked about possible export target for the current fiscal year, the adviser said the figure would not be disclosed before the EPB board approves it.\n",
      "Replying to query whether the export data mismatch will have any impact on gross domestic product (GDP) data, the finance adviser said he had also asked the officials to check it.\n",
      "Mr Ahmed said GDP is being calculated based on production method in 19 sectors. \"So, hopefully, it will have no impact on GDP. We will let you know about it later.\"\n",
      "Asked whether the government has any plan to revise the fiscal budget at this stage, the adviser said Planning Adviser Dr Wahiduddin Mahmud would look into the matter.\n",
      "\"If necessary, we will amend the budget. We will stop all unnecessary spending and rationalise them,\" he said.\n",

      "Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Dr Fahmida Khatun said the list for the interim government for immediate and midterm measures is long but some of the measures have to start during its term.\n",
      "She said the measures taken by the interim government should be carried out by the next government also when the new elected government comes.\n",
      "“But the initiatives have to be taken now, and this is the time,” she said while speaking at a webinar, noting that the challenges for the interim government are humongous.\n",
      "The economist said first of all, the interim government has to ensure political stability and also restore law and order situation because these are preconditions for economic prosperity and economic growth.\n",
      "She said the political turmoil which they have observed, during the student-led movement and also some of the actions by the previous government like Internet blackout, have an impact on the economy in the immediate term, and it will also have an impact in the medium term.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said these challenges are very difficult to deal with within limited time.\n",
      "She said the economy observed a reasonable rate of growth but there was a lack of authenticity of data during the past regime and the numbers were inflated as those were far from reality.\n",
      "“I have written earlier, that Bangladesh's growth story lacks justice and humanity, and this, I described from the point of the distributional aspect of the growth and the qualitative part of the growth,” she said, adding that that is why the student movement for quota reform was the manifestation of bigger problems that policymakers had overlooked for decades.\n",
      "In fact, Dr Fahmida said, the economy now requires reforms and there is a need for institutional reforms to bring discipline to the economic system.\n",
      "She said the corruption model which has been created over the decades, has benefited certain groups which she has mentioned by depriving the larger sections of the people.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida observed how the political turmoil in Bangladesh during the student-led mass uprising in July and August led to the collapse of the government on 5th August 2024.\n",
      "“So with this change, the interim government has to work on almost every front to fulfil the ambition of the students and people of the country. This is extremely challenging as the system has almost collapsed during the last 15 years,” she said.\n",
      "Dr Fahmida said the challenges on the economic front are formidable. Some of these challenges include high inflation, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, inefficiency and corruption in public projects implementation, low tax GDP ratio, low private and foreign investment, a weak financial sector, high nonperforming loans in the banking sector, illicit financial outflow, unemployment, and also poverty and inequality.\n",
      "Right to Freedom Board Member Jon Danilowicz moderated the webinar while Right to Freedom Executive Director Mushfiqul Fazal Ansarey gave a brief introduction of the panel of speakers and Ambassador (retd) William B Milam, Board President of the R2F offered opening remarks.\n",
      "Director of the South Asia Institute at Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Michael Kugelman and Secretary, Citizens for Good Governance Dr. Badiul Alam Mazumdar spoke at the webinar which aimed to foster conversations on critical aspects of Bangladesh’s new journey under the leadership of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus.\n",

      "Despite the interim government’s strong commitment to recover money laundered out of Bangladesh, experts say that the process will be challenging and complicated, reports UNB.\n",
      "A recent press statement from the Chief Adviser’s Office highlighted the government and Bangladesh Bank’s significant efforts to restructure the country’s banking sector, with a particular focus on recovering assets embezzled by corrupt individuals both locally and abroad.\n",
      "Officials confirmed that these laundered funds are a key target in a broader initiative to bring the financial sector up to international standards.\n",
      "The statement revealed that unscrupulous businessmen and influential figures have siphoned off vast sums from the banking sector, laundering these funds through fraudulent activities. \"Preliminary estimates suggest the total embezzled amount could exceed Tk 1 lakh crore, though the exact figure is still being determined,\" it said.\n",
      "Interim government Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has recently appealed to envoys from the UK and Switzerland for assistance in recovering the laundered funds.\n",
      "However, Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya, head of the White Paper Committee on the state of the country's economy, on Thursday acknowledged the daunting nature of the task. This is a very complex process, he told reporters after the committee’s first meeting. \"Tracking this money is not a simple matter at all.\"\n",
      "He explained that if the money is located, legal action must first be initiated under the host country’s laws. \"After obtaining a decree from the host country, it must then be presented in the destination country,” he said.\n",
      "Only after securing a decree from the destination country can the assets purchased with laundered money be frozen and sold to repatriate the funds.\n",
      "Dr. Debapriya also highlighted the need for solid, admissible documentation to support these legal efforts, stressing that identifying assets purchased with laundered money is a significant challenge.\n",
      "He noted that Bangladesh lacks the necessary treaties with many countries to facilitate the recovery of these funds and that the country does not have enough skilled lawyers and financial analysts to handle such cases effectively.\n",
      "Another prominent economist, who requested anonymity, told UNB that the Attorney General’s office must first establish the case of money laundering before sending a request to the country where the funds were smuggled. \"This is not a political issue and should be approached objectively,\" he said. \"It requires serious preparedness; otherwise, it risks being dismissed as mere political rhetoric.\"\n",
      "He outlined three critical aspects that need to be addressed: previous experiences, the capacity of the Attorney General’s office, and the involvement of foreign missions in international legal processes. \"All three areas must be prepared before attempting to recover the smuggled money,\" he added.\n",
      "Supreme Court Advocate, Barrister ARM Ahsanul Haq Khan, echoed these sentiments, stating that recovering the laundered money would be an extremely tough job for the government due to the many complexities involved.\n",
      "Strong political will is essential to initiate the process, followed by the coordinated efforts of the Bangladesh Bank, NBR, ACC, and the Attorney General’s office, along with the Home, Finance, and Foreign ministries, he said.\n",
      "He emphasized that Bangladesh would also need to secure agreements with the specific countries involved. \"While the government’s move is commendable, it is a very tough and challenging task for the interim government.\"\n",
      "To date, according to the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh has successfully recovered approximately 20.41 lakh Singapore dollars (equivalent to Tk 13 crore) in 2012, laundered by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko.\n",

      "Bangladesh needs to prioritise expanding its export markets before fully adopting local-currency settlements in external trade, according to a recent report by Bangladesh Bank (BB).\n",
      "The special study titled \"Trading in Local Currencies: Problems and Prospects for the SAARC Countries,\" was led by Dr. Sayera Younus, Executive Director (Research) at Bangladesh Bank.\n",
      "In mid-2023, Bangladesh and India initiated the settlement of bilateral trade in Indian rupees (INR) to reduce over-dependence on the US dollar.\n",
      "However, insiders at the central bank indicated that the initiative is yet to gain significant traction among traders.\n",
      "On July 11 last year, India and Bangladesh officially launched cross-border trade settlements in Indian rupees as part of efforts to lessen reliance on the US dollar.\n",
      "Between July and December 2023, two banks facilitated transactions worth 3.51 million rupees which is much lower than the bilateral trade between the two countries.\n",
      "And, Bangladesh continues to face a huge trade deficit with India and encounters challenges in using the rupee, including high demand for US dollars and limited rupee earnings.\n",
      "The study report highlights that trading in local currencies can serve as an effective tool to promote cooperation within the SAARC region.\n",
      "However, the study emphasises the importance of regional initiatives, bilateral agreements, and private sector engagement to enhance local currency trade in SAARC.\n",
      "\"These measures aim to improve trading efficiency, reduce costs, and boost trade competitiveness and volumes by minimising currency conversion complexities,\" it notes.\n",
      "It also underscores the need to shift exporter and importer attitudes through educational initiatives and capacity building to encourage the use of local currencies.\n",
      "Additionally, the study stresses the importance of gradually relaxing capital flow restrictions to establish a secure trade settlement system.\n",
      "\"Tariff and non-tariff barriers among member countries should be reduced,\" the report suggests, adding that foreign exchange regulations should be adapted to promote the use of local and regional currencies in trade and investment.\n",

      "After the meeting, the finance adviser said the UK is willing to help Bangladesh reform sectors like banking, revenue and capital markets.\n",
      "\"Those are very immediate concerns for us also. Because, unless we carry out those reforms it would be difficult for us,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\n",

      "All three diaspora bonds of the government have lost attractiveness to expatriates for low profit rates they yield, causing the negative investment growth of the instruments for the past three years.\n",
      "The negative growth in net sales of the state-backed bonds was Tk 19.13 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, Tk 20.06 billion in FY23 and Tk 13.95 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Of the bonds, according to the Department of National Savings (DNS), the Wage Earner Development Bond (WEDB) has a relatively high rate of return.\n",
      "It has negative growth too, as the largest investor, merchant mariners, cannot invest in this bond due to definition-related complications.\n",
      "The yield rate of the WEDB is highest at 12 per cent, the US Dollar Premium Bond at 7.50 per cent and the US Dollar Investment Bond at 6.50 per cent.\n",
      "However, these rates have further been changed into different slabs in January this year, such as above Tk 500,000, the rate is 4.0 per cent for investment bond and 5.0 per cent for premium bond on maturity.\n",
      "In the case of the WEDB, there will be a profit of 9.0 per cent for above Tk 5.0 million.\n",
      "Overall investment has dropped for the past two years. Expatriates' net investment on these three bonds was Tk 9.32 billion in FY21 and Tk 12.46 billion in FY20.\n",
      "The gross sales of the NRB (non-resident Bangladeshi) bonds were Tk 11.06 billion in FY24, Tk 11.72 billion in FY23 and Tk 9.83 billion in FY22.\n",
      "While sales of diaspora bonds are on the decrease, expatriates' investments in treasury bonds are increasing gradually.\n",
      "Tareq Muhammad Zakaria, deputy secretary (savings) at the Internal Resources Division (IRD), says expatriates are investing more in treasury bonds.\n",
      "The NRBs also have better investment options in their destination countries. For these reasons, investment in diaspora bonds is not increasing, he argues.\n",
      "The government is paying up to a 13-per cent yield on treasury bonds and up to 12 per cent on treasury bills.\n",
      "Statistics available with the Bangladesh Bank show monthly outstanding treasury bonds held by non-resident investors increased to Tk 7.55 billion in June 2024 from Tk 30 million in July 2023.\n",
      "DEFINITION COMPLEXITIES\n",
      "Merchant mariners are the largest customers of the WEDB. So far, they have appealed many times to resume the investment scope. The government has not given any solution to this end yet.\n",
      "Mariners, also known as seafarers who spend most of their lives on vessels, do not stay long in any country as they have to sail from port to port to perform professional duties.\n",
      "For this reason, they are not defined as remitters.\n",
      "Back in 2020, the IRD issued a notification barring merchant mariners from investing in the WEDB, an attractive scheme meant for them for good rates and a death-risk benefit.\n",
      "For this reason, the sailors, mostly educated and skilled workforce, have invested their hard-earned money abroad since 2020, while their native country faces a depletion of forex reserves.\n",
      "According to the IMF calculation, the forex reserve currently stands at $20.48 billion as of August 21.\n",
      "The seafarers, numbering more than 16,000, used to invest in the bond before 2020, says Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association (BMMOA) president Capt Md Anam Chowdhury.\n",
      "\"An estimated $600 million worth of their total income is now being invested outside of the country each year as they are currently not eligible to invest in the WEDB.\"\n",
      "The net negative growth of the WEDB was Tk 14.85 billion in FY24, Tk 16.11 billion in FY23 and Tk 4.15 billion in FY22.\n",
      "Investment in this bond has fallen for the past two years as well. The net investment was Tk 10.15 billion in FY21 and Tk 11.53 billion in FY20.\n",
      "BMMOA, the apex trade body of merchant mariners, has sent 12 letters to various government departments since 2020 requesting permission to purchase the wage-earner bond.\n",
      "They applied to the finance ministry on the 18th of this month.\n",
      "\"About 90-per cent of mariners are employed in contract ships and have no gratuity or pension benefits. The WEDB is the prime investment scheme for their earning source after retirement,\" cited the letter.\n",
      "\"Therefore, we strongly believe that the resumption of bond purchase facilities for mariners will increase the inflow of foreign exchange in the current critical situation of the country's foreign exchange reserve.\"\n",
      "The central bank in a letter also requested the IRD on 24 November 2022 to allow mariners and pilots to buy the bond to boost remittance inflow.\n",
      "UNWISE POLICY\n",
      "Economists say it is crucial to take initiatives to increase remittance flow in the country at this critical moment of foreign-exchange reserves.\n",
      "As Bangladesh has been facing a dollar dearth in recent years, the government should have adjusted the rates of dollar bonds to market rates, they said.\n",
      "Dr M Masrur Reaz, chairman of the Policy Exchange of Bangladesh, said since the rates of profits in other schemes, including treasury bonds, are high, the rates of NRB bonds should be fixed proportionally.\n",
      "\"Seafarers are earning US dollars, so why can't they buy NRB bonds?\" he pointed out, thereby suggesting the government come out of wrong policies, as the country is going through a remittance crisis.\n",
      "Mr Reaz feels that other remittance earners should also be allowed to invest in NRB bonds to help boost foreign-currency reserves.\n",
      "Prof Dr Muinul Islam, former chairperson at the Department of Economics at Chattogram University, also suggested allowing sailors to buy the WEDB.\n",
      "When asked, he said Bangladeshi migrants should primarily be encouraged to remit through formal channels. Then they might be motivated to invest in these bonds as well.\n",

      "Earlier, the limit was Tk 0.30 million, reports BSS.\n",
      "The central bank has hiked the limit once in each of the previous three weeks, which it imposed after the deterioration of the law and order and overall security situation in the country since the fall of the Awami League government on August 5.\n",
      "Initially, the BB slapped the restriction on withdrawals of over Tk 0.10 million as banks were facing challenges in transferring cash from one place to another.\n",
      "Earlier the central bank instructed commercial banks to monitor transactions through cheques and block any suspicious transfer of funds.\n",

      "“It is very difficult to determine the price hike through the average inflation rate. The price of an item worth Tk 100 has now increased to Tk 150. Although the average inflation is said to be 10 to 12 per cent, prices of essential commodities have increased by at least 50 per cent,” Dr Mustafizur Rahman said.\n",

      "Body : \n",
      "The Bangladesh Bank is set to announce a decision to raise interest rates from 8.5 per cent to 9.0 per cent in a day or two, Governor Ahsan H Mansur said.\n",
      "In an interview with BBC at the central bank’s offices in Dhaka on Wednesday, Mansur said he would raise rates further to 10 per cent or more in the coming months to tame inflation.\n",
      "The country’s average inflation rose to 11.66 per cent in July, the first month of the fiscal year 2024-25. A month ago, the inflation rate had come down to single digits in June, reports bdnews24.com.\n",
      "AH Mahmood Ali, former finance minister of the Sheikh Hasina government ousted by a mass movement, had aspirations for a sizable improvement in the new fiscal year despite the high inflation rates over the past two years.\n",
      "He also set an ambitious target for the current fiscal year. In the budget speech, he spoke about the goal of keeping the country's average inflation rate at 6.5 per cent in the budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n",
      "However, the ambitious target was thwarted when the student movement demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs started at the beginning of the current fiscal year.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had asked Bangladesh to tighten its monetary policy and keep exchange rates flexible while extending a $4.7 billion bailout for Bangladesh.\n",
      "Mansur told the BBC that he was in conversation with the body to \"augment\" and \"front load\" this amount by an additional $3.0 billion.\n",
      "Bangladesh was also seeking an additional $1.5 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion each from the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, he said.\n",
